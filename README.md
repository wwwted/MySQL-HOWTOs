MySQL HOWTO's
===================
![icon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/MySQL.svg/124px-MySQL.svg.png)

Below there are several guides on getting started with tools and features around MySQL.
Some howtos are under construction but Audit, Firewall and the Query Rewrite are done, rest will be finalized soon. 

If you want to be able to copy-n-paste the commands from the demo sections in the howto's use my simple install script to setup MySQL, more information [here](howtos/install.md). Some features require MySQL Enterprise Edition and you can follow this [guide](./howtos/edelivery-ee.md) to download MySQL Enterprise Edition.

All of the guides should work with both MySQL 5.7 and MySQL 8.
